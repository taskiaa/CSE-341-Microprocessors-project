This is a **Rock-Paper-Scissors game** written in Assembly language for DOS. When you run it, the program asks you to choose between two modes:

1. **Player vs Computer**
2. **Player vs Player**



###  **How it works:**

* If you pick **Player vs Computer**, it asks for your name and then plays 5 rounds.

  * You pick Rock (1), Paper (2), or Scissors (3).
  * The computer makes a random choice.
  * After each round, it shows if you won, lost, or tied â€” and updates the score.
  * Whoever reaches 10 points or finishes 5 rounds first wins.

* If you pick **Player vs Player**, both players take turns entering their choices.

  * It plays 5 rounds and keeps track of each player's score.
  * After the last round, it announces the winner or a draw.

* After the game ends, it asks if you want to play again.



### **What it teaches / shows:**

* Basic **user input/output** in Assembly
